# TOOL(S)

Open ```font-3x5-painter.html``` in a browser to draw 3x5 font characters (if you want to add or change any).
These are used in the file ```effects-wordclock.ino``` in the ```LEDCircleClock``` folder.

You can use the ```trigger-effect.sh``` script if you are running on a linux or mac computer (or in windows
in a linux compatible shell) to start showing an effect.
Make sure to update the IP variable in the script to point to the ip-address of your clock. Or you can use
a DNS name, in case your router assigns names to internal addresses.
Of course you can also just use the web-gui of the clock from within your browser.
